# CPU Verification

TODO: Add a run for each of the clients.

Quick fix is to add the images we currently have:

## Normal Clients [C1 and D1]

![C1AndD1](./RunBetweenC1AndD1.png)

## Tor Normal Clients [C2 and D2]

Run 1
![C2AndD2](./RunBetweenC2AndD2.png)

Run 2
![C2AndD22](./RunBetweenC2AndD2_2.png)

## Conclusion

The clients is just on the limit, but they can handle the calls.
